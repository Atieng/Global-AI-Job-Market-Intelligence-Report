    "The global job market for AI and Data Science roles is rapidly expanding as organizations accelerate AI adoption across industries. AI-related job postings have increased significantly in recent years, with some reports showing growth of over 70% year-over-year, and median salaries for AI engineers reaching around $185,000 annually. This growth is driven by rising demand for advanced technical skills, remote work normalization, and global digital transformation. Companies need insights into skill demand, salary benchmarks, and workforce distribution, while job seekers must understand which skills to prioritize and where opportunities are highest.\n"

Organizations lack data-driven guidance for competitive compensation and talent acquisition, while job seekers face uncertainty about which skills to prioritize and what salary expectations are realistic. Therefore, there is a need to analyze the Global AI Job Market dataset to uncover key trends and develop predictive models that support informed decision-making for both employers and professionals."
